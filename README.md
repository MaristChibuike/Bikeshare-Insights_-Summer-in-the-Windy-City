# Bikeshare-Insights_-Summer-in-the-Windy-City

This dataset contains information on Divvy Bikes, a bikeshare program that provides residents and visitors of Chicago with a convenient way to explore the city. 

The workspace is set up with one CSV file containing bikeshare activities at the peak of the summer-July 2023. Columns include ride ID, bike type, start and end times, station names and IDs, location coordinates, and member type.

# Bike Data Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of ride data from a bike-sharing service. The analysis was conducted using Jupyter Notebook and various Python libraries. Below, you will find an overview of the analysis, along with key findings and visualizations.

## Overview

This analysis seeks to gain insights from bike ride data, exploring various aspects of bike usage and rider behavior. The dataset includes information about ride start and end times, locations, ride types, and more.

The analysis is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the data:

- **Bike Type Analysis**: Explore the distribution and popularity of different bike types.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Investigate trends in ride durations, start times, and ride counts.
- **Station Analysis**: Identify frequently used start and end stations and analyze station imbalances.
- **Member vs. Casual Riders**: Compare ride durations and preferences between member and casual riders.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualize station locations on a map and explore geographic patterns.
- **Ride Duration Analysis**: Investigate the distribution of ride durations and potential outliers.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Examine ride patterns across different seasons.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explore correlations between variables within the dataset.

## Getting Started

To explore the analysis and findings, follow these steps:
1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`) in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Run the notebook cells to see the analysis, visualizations, and findings.

## Requirements

The analysis was conducted using Python, and the following libraries were used:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- folium (for geospatial visualization)
- plotly (for interactive visualizations)
- fastparquet / pyarrow (for loading parquet file)

You can install these libraries using `pip` or `conda` as follows:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib folium plotly fastparquet pyarrow
